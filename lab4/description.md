# Product Design

The proposed product is an application for teachers and students, containing tests/surveys. It is necessary for convenient communication within the university, the advantage of tests is automated verification, the teacher can not waste his time analyzing the results
Survey objectives:

1. Tests on the passed topic (every week / two weeks) to understand the assimilation of information among students. You can also create charts and graphs on academic performance in each student's personal account.
2. Feedback about the course and the teacher (at the end of the semester/year).

Basic ideas:

1. A system of notifications and deadlines when posting a test from a teacher. The ability to sync with Google Calendar, for example
2. A kind of to-do sheet with unfulfilled, completed, planned (there is information about which day the teacher will post the assignment) tests.
3. Charts in your personal account with academic performance in all subjects and for each one individually
4. A platform for posting notes for students and analyzing tests for teachers. You can do this both on your own page and within communities.
